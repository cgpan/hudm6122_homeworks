HUDM 6122 Multivariate Analysis is taught by Prof.Motta, Giovanni in spirng semester 2023 at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Welcome to review and give feedbacks. All the information is for reference only, please don't copy and paste directly.


## Homework_01 solutions  
The datasets can be found in the `textbook.R` file.

## Homework_02 solutions  - Data Visualization  

comment: Some of the graphs may not looking good. What I believe is that one should not memories exact R syntax in data visualization. Rather, you should learn by doing and searching for certain techniques when you feel necessary. Wasting too much time on tuning few lines of code is meaningless for graduate student.

## Homework_03 solutions - Principle Component Analysis  

Honework 03 is about sovling all the exercises of Chapter 3 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*. Due to the limited time and weekly workload, some of the code can be improved to be more elegant, generalized, and concise. Welcome to review and give your comment.
