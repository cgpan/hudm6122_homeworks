# hudm6122_homeworks  
This repo is to record and sync my progress in HUDM6122.
HUDM 6122 Multivariate Analysis is taught by Prof.Motta, Giovanni in spirng semester 2023 at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Welcome to review and give feedbacks. All the information is for reference only, please follow the university's **Honor Code** and don't copy and paste directly.

## Homework_01 solutions  
The datasets can be found in the `textbook.R` file.

## Homework_02 solutions  - Data Visualization  

comment: Some of the graphs may not looking good. What I believe is that one should not memories exact R syntax in data visualization. Rather, you should learn by doing and searching for certain techniques when you feel necessary. Wasting too much time on tuning few lines of code is meaningless for graduate student.

## Homework_03 solutions - Principle Component Analysis  

Honework 03 is about sovling all the exercises of Chapter 3 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*. Due to the limited time and weekly workload, some of the code can be improved to be more elegant, generalized, and concise. Welcome to review and give your comment.

## Homework_04 solutions - Multidimensional Scaling  

Honework 04 is about sovling all the exercises of Chapter 4 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*. Due to the limited time and weekly workload, some codes may not be the most elegant and concise. Welcome to review and give your comment.

## Homework_05 solutions - Exploratory Factor Analysis

Homework 05 focuses on praticing the exploratory factor analysis techniques. The method introduced from textbook might be not enough for more complex situation. Before running factor analysis, doing some assumption checking would be more rigorous. Therefore, I tried two methods in Exercises 5.4. Welcome to review and give your feedback.

Finished at 03.23.2023.

HW05 Solutions V1.1 updated at 03.24.2023:
- added the omitted solutions for ex5.6.  
- Revised the answer to the question (a) for ex5.6.  

## Homework_06 solutions - Clustering

Homework 05 focuses on praticing the clustering methods like K-means and finite mixture approach. For the question Ex 6.2, the graph I created is not that elegant and easy-to-read.  Welcome to share your idea(s)! Thanks a lot!  

For the second part of Ex6.3's solution, I asked Xue Yu for help and I think her method is reasonable!
