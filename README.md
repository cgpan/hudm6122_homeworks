# hudm6122_homeworks  
This repo is to record and sync my progress in HUDM6122.
HUDM 6122 Multivariate Analysis is taught by Prof.Motta, Giovanni in spirng semester 2023 at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Welcome to review and give feedbacks. All the information is for reference only, please follow the university's **Honor Code** and don't copy and paste directly.

## Homework_01 solutions  
The datasets can be found in the `textbook.R` file.

## Homework_02 solutions  - Data Visualization  

comment: Some of the graphs may not look good. I believe one should not memorize exact R syntax in data visualization. Rather, you should learn by doing and search for certain techniques when necessary. Wasting too much time on tuning few lines of code is meaningless for graduate students. 

Finished at 02.08.2023.

## Homework_03 solutions - Principle Component Analysis  

Homework 03 is about solving all the exercises of Chapter 3 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*. Due to the limited time and weekly workload, some code can be improved to be more elegant, generalized, and concise. Welcome to review and give your comments.

Finished at 02.23.2023.

## Homework_04 solutions - Multidimensional Scaling  

Homework 04 is about solving all the exercises of Chapter 4 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*. Due to the limited time and weekly workload, some codes may not be the most elegant and concise. Welcome to review and give your comments.

Finished at 03.02.2023.  


## Homework_05 solutions - Exploratory Factor Analysis

Homework 05 focuses on practicing the exploratory factor analysis techniques. The method introduced in the textbook might not be enough for more complex situations. Before running factor analysis, doing some assumption checking would be more rigorous. Therefore, I tried two methods in Exercise 5.4. Welcome to review and give your feedback.

Finished at 03.23.2023.

HW05 Solutions V1.1 updated at 03.24.2023:
- added the omitted solutions for ex5.6.  
- Revised the answer to the question (a) for ex5.6.  

## Homework_06 solutions - Clustering

Homework 06 focuses on practicing the clustering methods like K-means and finite mixture approach. For question Ex 6.2, the graph I created is not elegant and easy to read.  Welcome to share your idea(s)! Thanks a lot!  

For the second part of Ex6.3's solution, I asked Xue Yu for help, and I think her method is reasonable!  

V1.0 Finished at 03.31.2023.  

V1.1 adds one line of code to Ex6.2 to add the value label to each point.

Welcome to review and give your feedback  

## Homework_07 solutions - Clustering

Homework 07 is about practicing the clustering methods.  

For the first question, I gave two methods to solve it: the first is more rigorous via pure algebra (MATH IS SEXY!!!); the second is to validate it through data calculation.   

V1.0 finished at 04.13.2023.  

## Homework_08 solutions - Correspondence Analysis  

I referred to and cited Xue Yu's solution in question 3.  
Due to the **heavy workload during this final**, I finished this homework with no enough carefulness.  

## Homework_09 solutions - Structural Equational modeling  

This assignment provided solutions for the questions in Chapter 7 of the book *An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R*  

The biggest challenge is that the author did not clearly show how to get the data!!
