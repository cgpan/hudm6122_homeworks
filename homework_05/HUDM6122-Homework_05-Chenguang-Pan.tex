\subsection{Ex 5.1}\label{ex-5.1}}

\emph{Show how the result rises from the assumptions of uncorrelated
factors, independence of the specific variates, and independence of
common factors and specific variances. What form does take if the
factors are allowed to be correlated?}

\textbf{MY SOLUTION:}\\
Based on the assumption of Exploratory Factor Analysis(EFA), a set of
observed variables \textbf{x} assumed to be linked to a set of latent
variables \textbf{f}. Therefore, we can have a regression model in
matrix form
\[\boldsymbol x=\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f + \boldsymbol u\],
where \(\boldsymbol \Lambda\) is a \(q \times k\) matrix of factor
loadings (a.k.a., the coefficients of the regression model), and the
\emph{u} is the vector of unexplained error of each observed variables.

Let's take the variance of the formula above
\[V(\boldsymbol x) = V(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f + \boldsymbol u)\].
Based on the operation rule of variance, like
\[V(a+b)= V(a) + V(b) + 2Cov(ab)\], we combined the two formulas above,
then
\[V(\boldsymbol x) = V(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f + \boldsymbol u) = V(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f) + V(\boldsymbol u) + 2 Cov(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f \boldsymbol u)\].
Since the we assumed that the error terms are uncorrelated with the
factors, therefore the
\(Cov(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f \boldsymbol u)=0\). Then, we can
continue to drive the variance formula as
\[V(\boldsymbol x) = V(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol f) + V(\boldsymbol u) = \boldsymbol\Lambda V(\boldsymbol f) \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi\].
In addition, we assumed that the factors are uncorrelated with each
other. The \(V(\boldsymbol f)\) is actually an identity matrix.
Therefore, the formula can be written as
\[V(\boldsymbol x) = \boldsymbol\Lambda V(\boldsymbol f) \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi = \boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi\].
Finally, the formula can be written as
\[\boldsymbol \Sigma = \boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi\].

If we allow the factors to be correlated with each other, then the
\(V(\boldsymbol f)\) is not an identity matrix. Let's use the greek
letter \(\Phi\) to represent the variance matrix of loadings \textbf{f}.
Thus, the formula should be
\[\boldsymbol \Sigma = \boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol \Phi \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi\].

\subsection{Ex 5.2}\label{ex-5.2}}

\emph{Show that the communalities in a factor analysis model are
unaffected by the transformation \ldots{}}

\textbf{MY SOLUTION:}\\
This question mentioned that we need to use the transformed factor
loadings \(\boldsymbol \Lambda ^* = \boldsymbol \Lambda \boldsymbol M\).
Let's assume that \(\boldsymbol M\) is an \(k \times k\) orthogonal
matrix. We can re-write the the basic regression equation linking the
observed and the factors as:
\[\boldsymbol x=(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol M)( \boldsymbol M^T \boldsymbol f) + \boldsymbol u\].\\
Using the rule of variance, we can have
\[\boldsymbol \Sigma = (\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol M)(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol M)^T + \Psi\].
Since the \(\boldsymbol M\) is a orthogonal matrix and
\(\boldsymbol M \boldsymbol M^T = \boldsymbol I\). Therefore, the
variance equation can be written as
\[\boldsymbol \Sigma = \boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol\Lambda^T + \Psi\].
That is, the transformed factor loadings
\(\boldsymbol \Lambda ^* = \boldsymbol \Lambda \boldsymbol M\) will not
influence the communalities (i.e.,
\(\boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol\Lambda^T\)) in the a factor analysis
model.

\hypertarget{ex-5.3}{%
\subsection{Ex 5.3}\label{ex-5.3}}

\emph{Give a formula for the proportion of variance explained by the jth
factor estimated by the principal factor approach.}

\textbf{MY SOLUTION:}\\
The proportion of variance explained by the jth factor represents the
proportion of the total variance in the observed variables that is
accounted for by that factor alone. Therefore, the formula could be
\[Proportion_j = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{q} \lambda_{ij}^2}{\boldsymbol \Lambda \boldsymbol \Lambda ^T}\]
